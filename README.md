# JS Mini Projects

## Description
A collection of **JavaScript mini projects and experiments** created for learning, practice, and portfolio purposes. Projects range from **simple utilities and games** to slightly more complex tools, along with a dedicated folder for **JS Micros**, which are small, focused experiments.

---

## Purpose
- Strengthen **JavaScript fundamentals**: DOM manipulation, events, localStorage, API usage  
- Practice **UI/UX, responsiveness, and small interactions**  
- Build a **portfolio-ready set of projects** for reference or demonstration

---  

## Folder Structure / Example Projects
- `Calculator` → simple arithmetic operations  
- `Counter` → increment/decrement/reset with animations  
- `Countdown-Timer` → set a timer and count down  
- `Memory_Game` → classic memory matching game  
- `Expense-Tracker` → track expenses with localStorage  
- `Weather-App` → fetch weather from API  
- `Typing-Speed_Tester` → test typing speed and accuracy  
- `JS-Micros/` → small, experimental JS projects (e.g., checklist tracker)  
- …and many more mini-projects for practice  
---

## Usage
- Open the project folder  
- Open `index.html` in a browser to run the project  
- No installation required for basic functionality  
- Some projects may require an internet connection (for API usage)  

---

## Notes / Best Practices
- Projects are **mostly learning experiments**, not production-level apps  
- Code is organized for **modularity, readability, and practice**  
- More projects and enhancements may be added over time
