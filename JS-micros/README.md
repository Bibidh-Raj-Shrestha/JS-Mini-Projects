# JS Micros (“Built purely for learning and enjoyment—because why not!” 😎)

## Description:
A collection of tiny JavaScript experiments and mini-projects done for practice, fun, and learning. Each micro project is self-contained and focuses on a small concept or feature in JavaScript.

---

## Purpose:

- Practice DOM manipulation, events, and JS logic
- Experiment with UI, interactivity, and simple features
- Build small, reusable code snippets

---

## Structure:

Each micro project has its own folder with `index.html` (and optional `style.css` / `script.js`)
 
---

## Notes:

These are not production projects, just fun side experiments

Will continue adding more micros over time
